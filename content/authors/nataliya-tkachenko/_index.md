**MultimodalAI'24 Keynote Title:** Ethical challenges for multimodal conversational banking & parametric insurance

**MultimodalAI'24 Keynote Abstract:** Ever since mass-propagation of generative AI models, multimodal data has been getting increased attention from the customer-focused industries. Multimodal chatbots, which can process and respond to customer queries using enriched context, such as text, voice, and even visual data, offer significant advantages in customer banking and parametric insurance by enhancing user interaction, speed and overall service efficiency. Customers now have an option to choose their preferred mode of communication, whether through typing, speaking, or even using gestures. By analysing customer data from various sources, chatbots can offer personalised financial advice, investment recommendations, and alert about unusual activities. They even can help with the immediate payouts, by promptly verifying predefined parameters, such as weather data for crop insurance for example. However, with enriched context also come multi-dimensional ethical considerations, such as bias, fairness, transparency and confabulations. In this presentation I will cover how these risks emerge and mutually diffuse in highly automated interfaces.
