**MultimodalAI'24 Keynote Title:** An incredibly detailed picture of human health: the exciting potential of Our Future Health to prevent, detect and treat diseases

**MultimodalAI'24 Keynote Abstract:** In this presentation, I will detail the groundbreaking efforts of Our Future Health to construct a multimodal dataset encompassing 5 million individuals, representative of the UKâ€™s diverse population. I will explore the transformative potential of this dataset to enhance our capabilities in predicting, detecting, and treating major diseases. Additionally, I will discuss the roles of artificial intelligence in this context, focusing on the opportunities and challenges it presents. This exploration will underscore the potential of AI and large-scale data in shaping the future of healthcare.
