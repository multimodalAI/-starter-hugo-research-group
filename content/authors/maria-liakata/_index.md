Maria Liakata is Professor of NLP at the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London. She holds a UKRI/EPSRC Turing AI fellowship (2019-2025) on Creating time sensitive sensors from user-generated language and heterogeneous content. The research in this fellowship involves developing new methods for NLP and multi-modal data to allow the creation of [longitudinal personalized language monitoring](https://maria-liakata-nlp-group.github.io/). She has also led projects on language sensing for dementia monitoring & diagnosis, opinion summarisation, and rumour verification from social media. At the Alan Turing Institute she founded and co-leads the NLP and data science for mental health special interest groups. She has published over 180 papers on topics including semantics, summarisation, rumour verification, opinion mining, resources and evaluation and biomedical NLP. She is the PI of the newly funded UKRI/RAi UK Keystone project on [Addressing Sociotechnical Limitations of Large Language Models (AdSoLve)](https://adsolve.github.io/).
