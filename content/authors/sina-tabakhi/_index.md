Sina joined us in November 2021. Before joining our team, he had worked in the industry as a software engineer for five years. Sina has also developed a feature selection tool, <a href="https://unifeat.github.io/">Universal Feature Selection Tool (UniFeat)</a>, from his Master's work. He has started conducting research on multi-omics data integration by feature selection to obtain a deep understanding of molecular mechanisms. See <a href="https://sinatabakhi.github.io/">his homepage</a> for more information.
