On behalf of the Organizing Committee for the [Second Workshop on Multimodal AI (MultimodalAI'24)](https://multimodalai.github.io/), scheduled for June 25, 2024, at The Edge, University of Sheffield, UK, we are reaching out to invite you to become a sponsor.

Multimodal AI, at the forefront of technological advancement, seamlessly integrates various data modalities such as text, image, and sound, revolutionising our interaction with technology and data. MultimodalAI'24 serves as a nexus for researchers and practitioners from AI, data science, and diverse scientific and application domains to convene, discuss challenges, share insights, foster collaborations, and shape the future of multimodal AI.

This year's workshop boasts an exceptional lineup of keynote speakers, including Maria Liakata (Professor of NLP, Queen Mary University of London, Turing AI Fellow), Tian Xie (Principal Research Manager, Microsoft Research AI4Science), Nataliya Tkachenko (Generative AI Ethics & Assurance Lead, Lloyds Banking Group), and Adam Steventon (Director of Data Platforms, Our Future Health). Participants will have the opportunity to present lightning talks and posters, with four prizes (£150 each) awarded for the best presentations.
