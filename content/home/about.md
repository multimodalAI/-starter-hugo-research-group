Multimodal AI combines multiple types of data (image, text, audio, etc) via machine learning models and algorithms to achieve better performance. Multimodal AI is key for AI research and applications including healthcare, net zero, finance, robotics, and manufacturing. Multimodal AI in these areas is challenging due to the inherent complexity of data integration and the limited availability of labelled data. Unimodal AI for a single type of data input is maturing at an accelerating pace, thus creating vast opportunities for tackling multimodal AI challenges.

MultimodalAI’23 brings together researchers and practitioners from AI, data science, and various scientific and application domains to discuss problems and challenges, share experiences and solutions, explore collaborations and future directions, and build networks and a vibrant community on multimodal AI. We have three keynote speakers covering academic research, industrial research, and industrial applications: [Professor Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) (University of Edinburgh, UKRI Turing AI World-Leading Researcher Fellow), [Dr Yutian Chen](https://www.cantab.net/users/yutian.chen/index.html) (Google DeepMind, AlphaGo Developer), and [Dr Chew-Yean Yam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyyam/?originalSubdomain=uk) (Microsoft, Principal Data and Applied Scientist). We offer participants opportunities to give 3-min pitches and present posters, with four prizes (£150 each) in total for the best pitches and best posters.

The First Workshop on Multimodal AI aims to bring together machine learning researchers, data scientists, and domain experts from diverse backgrounds, career stages, and disciplines to share experiences and solutions, discuss open problems and future directions, and build networks and collaborations in multimodal data integration.
