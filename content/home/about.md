The First Workshop on Multimodal AI is a one day event that will bring together leading edge researchers interested in key challenges and application areas for Multimodal AI.
<br>
Multimodal data is common in applications including healthcare, finance, robotics, environment, multimedia, and manufacturing. Integrating multimodal data is a genuine need from these applications but it is a challenging problem for data science and artificial intelligence (AI) mainly due to the inherent complexity and the limited availability of labelled data.
<br>
The First Workshop on Multimodal AI aims to bring together machine learning researchers, data scientists, and domain experts from diverse backgrounds, career stages, and disciplines to share experiences and solutions, discuss open problems and future directions, and build networks and collaborations in multimodal data integration.
