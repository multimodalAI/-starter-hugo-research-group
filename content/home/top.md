<center><h1>Overview</h1></center>
Multimodal AI combines multiple types of data via machine learning models and algorithms to achieve better performance. Our goal is to assemble a select group of dedicated researchers and professionals for a collaborative effort aimed at producing a high-impact academic paper. The paper will focus on exploring data and problem-solving challenges in Multimodal AI, specifically beyond the well-trodden domains of vision and language. While the event aims to explore areas beyond the commonly researched domains of vision and language, insights and contributions from these fields are also highly valuable and welcome. Additionally, this event aims to lay the groundwork for ongoing, fruitful collaborations and to create a lasting impact in the field of Multimodal AI. Your participation will be instrumental in achieving these significant academic and collaborative milestones.
